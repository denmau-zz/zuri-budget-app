# zuri-budget-app

This is a project based on my Zuri Backend (Django) internship

Create a Budget class that can instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment. These objects should allow for:
1.  Depositing funds to each of the categories
2.  Withdrawing funds from each category
3.  Computing category balances
4.  Transferring balance amounts between categories

Push your code to GitHub, and submit the repo link.
